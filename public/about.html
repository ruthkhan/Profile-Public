    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>As an Engineer turned Product Manager, I excel in breaking down complex problems and working with teams to create solutions tailored to users' needs within resource constraints. Throughout my career, I have helped organizations design and build products that work for their users' context, redesigning business processes where necessary to support ongoing use, maintenance, and scalability of these products. </p>

    <p>I am a versatile and persistent problem-solver, always eager to creatively experiment and adapt solutions across different domains. My track record includes successful stints in Sustainability, Financial Services, Law Enforcement, Data, and Software Product Development. The diverse experiences have given me a broad suite of tools and sources of inspiration when problem solving. It also allows me to cultivate deeper relationships and communicate effectively with stakeholders ranging from C-Suite through business, design, engineering, and IT delivery. Most recently, I completed a fullstack software development bootcamp in Python and JavaScript, which has equipped me with more tools for prototyping and a better appreciation of the challenges that software engineers face. </p>

    <p>Having recently moved to the Bay Area, I look forward to serving more communities, working with teams from varied backgrounds, and tackling new challenges. Do get in touch!</p>
